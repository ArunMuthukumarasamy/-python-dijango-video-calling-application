# -python-django-video-calling-application
 DISCRPTION :
 
Video calling has become increasingly popular as a way to stay connected with friends, 
family, and colleagues, and video calling applications have been developed to make it easier than ever
to make video calls. This project aims to develop a video calling application using the Django 
framework. The application will provide users with the ability to initiate video calls without creating 
an account. It will also feature real-time video and audio streaming, encryption for secure calls, and
high-definition video quality. The application will be developed using the latest web technologies 
available, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, as well as using the Django framework. 
Additionally, third-party Agora APIs will be integrated for authentication and other features. The 
application will be tested for performance and usability, and will be optimized for mobile devices.
