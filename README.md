 DISCRPTION :
 
 Video calling has become increasingly popular as a way to stay connected with friends, 
family, and colleagues, and video calling applications have been developed to make it easier than ever
to make video calls. This project aims to develop a video calling application using the Django 
framework. The application will provide users with the ability to initiate video calls without creating 
an account. It will also feature real-time video and audio streaming, encryption for secure calls, and
high-definition video quality. The application will be developed using the latest web technologies 
available, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, as well as using the Django framework. 
Additionally, third-party Agora APIs will be integrated for authentication and other features. The 
application will be tested for performance and usability, and will be optimized for mobile devices. 

  EXISTING METHOD :
  
  The existing system for video calling application using Django is to create a web application 
using the Django framework and the Django REST Framework. The web application should use web 
sockets to allow users to make video calls to each other. This involves configuring server and setting 
up the client-side code. This app is inspired by many social media applications like Google Meet 
which help in connecting with people via Video Chat. The control options were hugely inspired from 
Google meet, Zoom meet. The minor flaws that were felt in the above mentioned apps where kept in 
mind, so that they can be removed, tuned or addressed.
